<!-- Definition of business -->

My family owns a shop that sells clothes, shoes and handbags targeting male and female between the ages of 20 and 50 who are business people and hardly find time to go to the market

<!-- Problem Statement -->

Everyone can own a shop but the management of these shops vary. Such is the case of our family shop however, we have an additional intangible asset that can help boost sales likewise management of this entity. This asset is none other than the knowledge which I have acquired from Seven which takes marketing to a whole digital level and thus gives us an upper hand against our competitors. The problem which we are therefore trying to solve is that of increasing sales and broadening our client base both in the short and long term. In the long-run a website would be built.

<!-- Motivation -->

My motivation is to raise our standard of living especially because my parents have sacrificed alot to get me to this prestigious institution and I can't afford to let them down.
